## 📂 Setup Instructions


This is a full-stack project with two main folders:  

- `frontend` → React app  
- `backend` → Node.js app  

This guide explains how to **fork, set up, and run the project locally** using **VS Code**.

---

## 📌 Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16+ or v18+ recommended)  
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)  
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## 🔗 Fork & Clone the Repository

1. **Fork** this repository (click the **Fork** button in GitHub).  
2. **Clone your fork** to your local machine:

```bash
# Using SSH
git clone git@github.com:YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/REPO-NAME.git

# Or using HTTPS
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/REPO-NAME.git
```

🖥 Open Project in VS Code

From the root folder:
```bash
code .
```
Or open VS Code → File → Open Folder… → select the project folder.

📦 Install Dependencies

Run the following commands inside VS Code terminal:

```bash
# Frontend dependencies
cd frontend
npm install

# Backend dependencies
cd ../backend
npm install
```

▶️ Run the Project

You need two terminals running in parallel in VS Code.

Step 1: Open two terminals

Go to Terminal → New Terminal
Then click the Split Terminal button (▭▭) to create a second terminal.

Step 2: Run frontend and backend

```bash
# Terminal A → Frontend
cd frontend
npm run dev

# Terminal B → Backend
cd backend
node index.js start
```

🌐 View in Browser

Once both servers are running, open:
```bash
👉 http://localhost:5173
```

Now project should run smooth on your device.
